# LFSR
LFSR, Easy Implementation with Feedback coefficients computation, numpy and Sympy needed

# For what kind of persons is it

Students who are to lazy to solve this from hand.

# How to use it?
Let's take a look at the Example. 
First we got this "1010000110111011" seqence, as you can see it is 16 Bits long so so we guess the degree of the polynom could be 8.
Now we use the function Matrix to solve the "Linear Equation System" and get the feedback coefficents
matrix("STRING OF OUTPUT BITS" , "GUESSES DEGREE OF THE POLYNOM")


Matrix returns the coefficients in this way:

After we got the coefficients we use the function lfsr() which outputs a lot. 
After every clock it prints all internals and at the end it prints the complete sequence generated by the lfsr and returns it.
